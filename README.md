# Microservices with Node.js and Angular

## Overview

This repository contains the code for Section 2 of the course "Microservices with Node.js and React" available on Udemy.

While the course is originally taught using React, I've implemented the examples and projects using Angular v17.

## Description

This course covers the fundamentals of building microservices using Node.js and React. I've adapted the code to use
Angular, providing an alternative perspective for those comfortable with Angular or interested in learning it alongside
microservices.

## Repository Structure

- **/src:** Contains the source code for the Angular implementation.
- **/examples:** Includes practical examples and exercises.
